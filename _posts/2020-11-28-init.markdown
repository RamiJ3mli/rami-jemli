For someone that discovered the green creature's witchcraft years ago, it's easier to notice the gargantuan leap forward in the Android developer experience. It's a huge shift. Today, it's a much faster and easier process for a fresh Android developer to reach a profession-ready level than it was years ago. We have kotlin as a modern programming language, a great amount of game-changing open source projects, libraries and tools, and there is a cornucopia of android-focused educational content out there. The latter comes in every form. Articles, videos, events, workshops, Q&A platforms, AMAs, etc. Most of which are created by outstanding talents and content creators whom we can easily call masters of their craft. There is no better time to be an android developer.

Personally, what i cherish the most about being an Android software creator is the ever-changing APIs and tools that Google and the community throw our way. There is always more to learn. There is always a better way to do things, and i find it delightful. 

The android community was crucial for my growth as a software creator. As an enthusiast, i think it’s about time i start doing my part and share back.

So, welcome to my place! I will be writing a lot of technical stuff about android, and hopefully, the green creature’s witchcraft catches on with you. Enjoy!
